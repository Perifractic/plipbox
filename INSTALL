INSTALL

How to setup your plip2slip device!

1. Get an Arduino 2009 board (see http://arduino.cc/)

2. Attach the missing hardware to your board -> see doc/hardware.txt

3. Flash the firmware:

   - Pick the right one for your AVR from the firmware directory
   - Use avrdude (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude/) to flash it:
   
     > avrdude -p m168 -P <your_serial_port> -b 19200 -c arduino -U flash:w:BUILD/plip2slip-0.1-500000-arduino-atmega168.hex
     > avrdude -p m328p -P <your_serial_port> -b 57600 -c arduino -U flash:w:BUILD/plip2slip-0.1-500000-arduino-atmega328.hex
   
   - Your serial port depends on your Operating System: 
     - Mac OS X uses /dev/cu.usbserial-*
     - Linux uses /dev/ttyUSB*
     - Windows uses COM*

   - Note: disconnect your Amiga before flashing!

4. Setup your TCP Stack on the Amiga -> see contrib/magplip/README

5. Setup SLIP on your Linux PC -> see contrib/slattach/README

6. Connect your Amiga and PC to the Arduino and power on both machines.

7. You should be able to communicate with your Amiga to the PC and the Internet...! Yay!
   Ping is your friend!

8. Check out plip2slip's advanced features -> sse doc/terminal.txt

9. Have fun!
