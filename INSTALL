INSTALL

How to setup your plipbox device:

 1. Build the hardware (see doc/hardware.txt)
 
 2. Flash the firmware
    - Connect the device to your Mac/PC via USB only
      (no Amiga or Ethernet connection yet!)
    - Flash the supplied firmware file with avrdude (see doc/firmware.txt)
 
 3. Configure plipbox via serial terminal
    - Setup your terminal program on your Mac/PC to connect to the 
      plipbox firmware
    - Configure the plipbox device (in command mode):
      - Enable DHCP mode or set netmask, gateway, ethernet port IP
        ('pd','pn','pg','pe' commands)
      - Adjust Amiga/PLIP port IP if necessary 
        ('pa','pp' commands)
      - Write Paramters to EEPROM to keep them
        ('ps' command)
     
 4. Test Ethernet Connectivity
    - Connect your plipbox to the Ethernet (keep PC terminal connected)
    - Test by pinging gateway or server
      - Use 'g' and 's' keys in terminal
        (press multiple times so ARP lookup can be performed)
    - If ping is replied -> Ok, Ethernet works!

 5. Test Amiga PLIP Connectivity  
    - Setup magplip networking on your Amiga (see contrib/magplip/README)
    - Connect device to Amiga (keep Ethernet and Mac/PC link)
    - Enable magplip on your Amiga
    - Have a look at the plipbox terminal: 
      "plip: online" tells you the magPLIP device was successfully detected
    - Test by pinging the Amiga from plipbox terminal
      - Use 'a' key in terminal to send ping
      - If ping is replied -> Amiga/plipbox networking is Ok!
    - Ping directly from your Amiga (call ping command in CLI):
      - ping PLIP port of plipbox
      - ping Ethernet port of plipbox
      - ping gateway or server on local ethernet
    - Ok, plipbox seems to work!
  
 6. Standalone Operation
    - Disconnect Mac/PC and stop terminal program there
    - Use a USB power supply to supply the Arduino with power
    - Connect Ethernet and Amiga to plipbox

Have fun!
