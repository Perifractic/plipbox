Hardware used to build a plipbox device
---------------------------------------

1. Arduino (2009)
----------------

Currently, the firmware is implemented on an Arduino 2009 board with an
ATmega328 running at 16 MHz. You can also use one of the many Arduino
clones if the ROM size is sufficient (32K or more, not 16K), the AVR chip 
matches and enough I/O pins are available.

A new Arduino Uno should work similarly, but I haven't tried it yet.

Setting up the missing parts for your plipbox isn't that hard:
All you need is to by some extra components and wire them together.


1.1 Network with ENC28J60 Chip

Additionally, you need a network shield or expansion card.
Please note, that you need a network card with a ENC28J60 chip from Microchip. 
Cards using a "WizNet" chip will _NOT_ work! 
(e.g. The Arduino Ethernet Shield)

I use the "ENC28J60 Ethernet Module" from iteadstudio [1].

Please note: If you use an Ethernet shield then make sure that the shield
does not require pins that are already used for the Amiga cable (see below).
E.g. the "ENC28J60 Ethernet Shield" from iteadstudio will not work as
it uses some DIGITAL pins for extra functions like an SD card.

The wiring of the Ethernet module is as follows:

 ENC28J60 Ethernet Module     Function           Arduino
    GND                         GND               GND
    SS                          Slave Select      DIGITAL 10 (PB2)
    MOSI                        Slave In Data     DIGITAL 11 (PB3)
    MISO                        Slave Out Data    DIGITAL 12 (PB4)
    SCK                         SPI Clock         DIGITAL 13 (PB5)
    VCC                         +3.3V Supply      *)
    
*) The Ethernet module needs a 3.3V supply while your Arduino needs to
run on +5V. Although the Arduiono already provides a +3.3V power source
on a pin, it will be too weak to feed the Ethernet chip. I opted to use
a 5V to 3.3V regulator to supply the ethernet module. You can use a 
ready-made 3.3V regulator board if you don't want to build it yourself.

1.2 Amiga Parallel Port Cable

You need to build a cable from the Amiga Parallel Port (DB 25 male) to the
Arduino. Try to use only a short wire length otherwise signal quality will suffer.
Up to 10 cm are suitable lengths.

Amiga Parallel Port         Function          Arduino
    17 ... 22                GND               GND Pin
    1                        /STROBE           DIGITAL 2 (PD2)
    13                       SELECT            DIGITAL 3 (PD3)
    11                       BUSY              DIGITAL 4 (PD4)
    12                       POUT              DIGITAL 5 (PD5)
    8                        DATA 6            DIGITAL 6 (PD6)
    9                        DATA 7            DIGITAL 7 (PD7)
    10                       /ACK              DIGITAL 8 (PB0)
    2 ... 7                  DATA 0 ... 5      ANALOG 0 ... 5 (PC0 ... PC5)


1.3 Serial Port for Terminal

The plipbox device can be configured and debugged via the serial console available
on all Arduino devices. Usually you don't need extra HW to access this serial 
port.

A virtual serial port is often available via the USB connection.

Alternatively, you can connect your plip box serial port directly to your Amiga 
and then use an Amiga terminal program to control the device. In this case you
need to connect the TxD, RxD and GND wires from your Arduino to a RS232 level
converter and then to your Amiga. The level converter is essential, as the Amiga
uses +/-12V signals and the Arduino 0/5V. _NEVER_ connect your Amiga directly!


That's it! All you need to construct your own plipbox HW is ready!
