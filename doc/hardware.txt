Hardware for the plip2slip device
---------------------------------

1. Arduino 2009
---------------

Currently the firmware is implemented on an Arduino 2009 board with an
ATmega168 running at 16 MHz. Similar AVR board should work, too, but note that
an FT232 USB-to-serial bridge with RTS/CTS hand shaking pins available at the
AVR is required.

The additional hardware required for the Arduino board consists of an adapter
for the Amiga parallel port, the RTS/CTS handshake lines on the board itself,
and 3 LEDs to show the operation modes.

All parts are fairly simple to construct.

1.1 Amiga Parallel Port Cable

You need to build a cable from the Amiga Parallel Port (DB 25 male) to the
Arduino. Try to use only a short wire length otherwise signal quality will suffer.
Up to 10 cm are suitable lengths.

Amiga Parallel Port         Function          Arduino
    17 ... 22                GND               GND Pin
    1                        /STROBE           DIGITAL 2 (PD2)
    13                       SELECT            DIGITAL 3 (PD3)
    11                       BUSY              DIGITAL 4 (PD4)
    12                       POUT              DIGITAL 5 (PD5)
    8                        DATA 6            DIGITAL 6 (PD6)
    9                        DATA 7            DIGITAL 7 (PD7)
    10                       /ACK              DIGITAL 8 (PB0)
    2 ... 7                  DATA 0 ... 5      ANALOG 0 ... 5 (PC0 ... PC5)

1.2 RTS/CTS RS 232 Handshaking

You need to connect the RTS/CTS lines from the FT232 to your AVR. On the
Arduino 2009 the RTS/CTS lines are available on solder pads on the board. Just
solder a wire and connect them to the given AVR pin:

  Arduino
    CTS (OUT):     DIGITAL 9 (PB1)
    RTS (IN):      DIGITAL 10 (PB2)

1.2.1 CTS Solder Pad:

.  Solder Pad X3                              DIGITAL .
.  4   3   2   1                                      .
.  (x) (x) (x) (x)                                    .
.               |                 CTS                 * 10
.               +---------------------------------->  * 9
.                                                     * 8
.                                                     .

The vanilla Arduino board does not allow to control the HW CTS serial signal
from the AVR chip. But this is required to allow high performance data
transfer for the dtv2ser firmware. Fortunately,this signal of the FT232 chip
is available on the solder pad X3 and can be added by soldering a wire from
there to a pin that is connected to the AVR port labeled "DIGITAL 9". 

1.2.2 RTS Solder Pad:

.  Solder Pad X3                              DIGITAL .
.  4   3   2   1                                      .
.  (x) (x) (x) (x)                RTS                 .
.                          +---------------------->   * 10
.                          |                          * 9
.                          *  *                       .
.                       unpopulated solder pads       .

The RTS line is available on the left solder pad of the unpopulated resistor
found on the right hand side of the X3 pads. The RTS line needs to be
connected to port DIGITAL 10 on the AVR.

NOTE: Do NOT connect the line to the right pad and do NOT short circuit poth
pads. The right line is the RESET line and will restart your board every time
RTS is triggeredâ€¦You have been warned ;)

1.3 Adding LEDs

Three LEDs with colors red, orange/yellow and green are soldered with 220 Ohm
resistors to +5V and the following DIGITAL pins:

.                      Red LED
.  Reset *         +------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 13
.    3V3 *         |  Orange LED
.     5V *---------+------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 12
.    GND *         |  Green LED
.    GND *--+      +------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 11
.    Vin *  |
.           |
.           v  This line is used for the Amiga parallel port

That's it! Your plip2slip HW is ready!
