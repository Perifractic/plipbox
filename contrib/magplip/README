1. Setup network stack

 - I am using AmiTCP (V3.x,4.x) here, but other Network Stacks work similar.
 
 - For a very simple setup you can use the "Network Boot Disk for Amiga"
   and start with this: http://jpv.wmhost.com/NetworkBootDisk/ 
   Insert this disk into your emulator and perform the following steps
   to prepare the disk.
        
 - Copy magplip.device from this directory to your AmiTCP installation.
   Select the m680x0 version and copy the magplip.device without the .000 or
   .020 extension to your AmiTCP installation:

        > copy magplip.device.000 df0:devs/networks/magplip.device

 - Edit the file "AmiTCP/db/interfaces" and add:
 
        magplip dev=devs:networks/magplip.device

 - Adjust your AmiTCP:bin/startnet to setup the interface to "magplip0".
   In the network boot disk: Edit "df0:s/Prefs/Env-Archive/nbddriver" (EnvARC:)
   and set "magplip0"

 - In EnvARC:sana2 (Network Boot Disk: "df0:s/Prefs/Env-Archive") you can
   place an optional configuration file called "magplip.config".
   For options see the magPLIP documentation.

 - Correctly set your IPs and use the same ones as defined in the plipbox
   firmware (see doc/firmware.txt):
   
     amiga IP      = address of your Amiga
     plip port IP  = address of the plipbox (on the PLIP port)
     
   In the network boot disk use EnvARC:nbdgw to set the plip port IP and
   EnvARC:nbdip to set the amiga IP.

 - Do not forget to configure the correct DNS server otherwise you won't be
   able to resolve non-numeric IP addresses. Have a look at the file
   AmiTCP:db/netdb-myhost and adapt the NAMESERVER entry accordingly.
   Use the DNS server of your local network here. (in my setup 192.168.2.1).
   The network boot disk uses the IP address stored in the EnvARC:nbdns file.


2. Build magPLIP from Source

 - Only for advanced users! All others can use the supplied binaries!
 - AMIGA: First setup latest SAS C++ V6.58
 - AMIGA: Install AmiTCP SDK (e.g http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/AmiTCP-SDK-4.3)

        > assign amitcpsdk: <set your sdk path herer>

 - Download and extract mapPLIP source from aminet
 - On Unix host: Apply patch: 

        > patch -p0 < magplip.patch

 - AMIGA CLI:

        > cd magplip/source
        > assign includeasm: include:
        > assign netinclude: amitcpsdk:netinclude
        > smake clean all_opt
        > list /devs/networks

 - The resulting binaries reside in /devs/networks/magplip.device.*
