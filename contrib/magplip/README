0. Changes

  2011-08-05  38.1a  plipbox support
  2012-06-03  38.1b  plipbox support

1. Build magPLIP from Source

 - Only for advanced users! All others can use the supplied binaries!
 - AMIGA: First setup latest SAS C++ V6.58
 - AMIGA: Install AmiTCP SDK (e.g http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/AmiTCP-SDK-4.3)

        > assign amitcpsdk: <set your sdk path herer>

 - Download and extract mapPLIP source from aminet
 - On Unix host: Apply patch: 

        > patch -p0 < magplip.patch

 - AMIGA CLI:

        > cd magplip/source
        > assign includeasm: include:
        > assign netinclude: amitcpsdk:netinclude
        > smake clean all_opt
        > list /devs/networks

 - The resulting binaries reside in /devs/networks/magplip.device.*


2. Setup network stack

 - I am using AmiTCP (V3.x,4.x) here, but other Network Stacks work similar
 
 - For a very simply setup you can use the "Network Boot Disk for Amiga"
   and start with this: http://jpv.wmhost.com/NetworkBootDisk/ 
   Insert this disk into your emulator and perform the following steps
   to prepare the disk.
        
 - Copy magplip.device to your AmiTCP. Select the m680x0 version and copy
   the magplip.device without the .000 or .020 extension to your AmiTCP
   installation:

        > copy magplip.device.000 df0:devs/networks/magplip.device

 - Edit the file "AmiTCP/db/interfaces" and add:
 
        magplip dev=devs:networks/magplip.device

 - Adjust your AmiTCP:bin/startnet to setup the interface to "magplip0".
 - In the network boot disk: Edit "df0:s/Prefs/Env-Archive/nbddriver" and
   set "magplip0"

 - In EnvARC:sana2 (Network Boot Disk: "df0:s/Prefs/Env-Archive") you can
   place an optional configuration file called "magplip.config".
   For options see the magPLIP documentation.

 - Do not forget to configure the correct DNS server otherwise you won't be
   able to resolve non numeric IP addresses. Have a look at the file
   AmiTCP:db/netdb-myhost and adapt the NAMESERVER entry accordingly. With
   enabled IP forwarding on your Linux box (see slattch/README) you typically
   use the IP of your DSL router as your nameserver (in my setup 192.168.2.1)
