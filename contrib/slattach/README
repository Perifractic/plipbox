slattach patch for high baud rates
----------------------------------

The slattach tool is a utility to setup a serial link as a SLIP device in the Linux Kernel.
The tool is distributed in the "net-tools" package.

slattach usually support only the "standard" baud rates up to 115200 baud.
In this project we will use higher baud rates up to 500000 baud.
To support this baud rate a patch is required.
See slattach.patch in this directory.

Depending on your Linux distributation patching slattach may vary.


Ubuntu/Debian net-tools
-----------------------

  - Prepare source and patch

        > sudo apt-get build-dep net-tools
        > apt-get source net-tools
        > dpkg-source -x net-tools_1.60-23ubuntu3.dsc
        > cd net-tools-1.60
        > cp slattach.patch debian/patches
        > echo slattach.patch >> debian/patches/series

  - Quick & Dirty:

        > cd net-tools-1.60
        > dpkg-buildpackage -Tbuild
        > ls slattach
        
        Find pacthed slattach in this directory!

  - OR: Build your own patched net-toosl package and install this

        > debuild -us -uc
        > cd .. ; ls *.deb
        net-tools_1.60-23ubuntu3_i386.deb 
        > sudo dpkg -i net-tools_1.60-23ubuntu3_i386.deb 
         

Using slattach to setup SLIP
----------------------------

1. First manual test

   - Attach your Arduino with plip2slip firmware
   - On Linux a new /dev/ttyUSBx should appear
     (Have a look a dmesg output for details) 

   - Attach SLIP device to serial:
   
        > sudo ./slattach -H -p slip -s 500000 /dev/ttyUSB0
        
        Note: the high baud rate only works with the patched version
        Note2: the -H is also added by the patched version. It avoids
               resetting the Arduino before/after connecting.
               Otherwise you can't read out stats from the board later on.

   - If you get the following error then you don't have patched slattach:
   
        slattach: tty_open: cannot set 500000 bps!
   
   - Let this command run all the time you want to have a SLIP device...
     The serial port is then blocked. If you want to talk with the device
     by serial or flash the firmware then first kill the slattach (e.g.
     by CTRL+C)
   
   - Now configure the SLIP network interface:
     (With slattach still running)
   
        > sudo ifconfig sl0 netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 up
        > ifconfig sl0
        sl0       Link encap:Serial Line IP  
                  inet addr:192.168.0.1  P-t-P:192.168.0.1  Mask:255.255.255.255
                  UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:296  Metric:1
                  RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
                  TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
                  collisions:0 txqueuelen:10 
                  RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)
        
   - Ok! Now a ping should work!
   
        > ping 192.168.0.1

   - You can alter the MTU of the link with:
   
        > sudo ip link set dev sl0 mtu <size>

2. Setup permanently

   - To make these changes permanently open file 
     /etc/network/interfaces as root and add:
  
        iface sl0 inet static
        	address 192.168.0.1
        	netmask 255.255.255.0
        	mtu 512
        	pre-up /usr/local/bin/slattach -H -l -p slip -s 500000 /dev/ttyUSB0 &
        	pre-up sleep 1
        	post-down kill `cat /var/lock/LCK..ttyUSB0`

   - Note: I copied my patched slattach to /usr/local/bin

   - Then you can control the interface with:
   
        > sudo ifup sl0
        > sudo ifdown sl0
